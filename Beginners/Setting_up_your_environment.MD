#  Setting up your environment


- Since the programming language comes with a variety of toolchains, tools, linkers, and compiler versions, choosing the best-fitting variation is not easy. Additionally, Rust works on all major operating systems—which adds another variable. 

- However, installing Rust has become a trivial task when using rustup (https://rustup.rs/). On the website, a helpful script (or installer on Windows) that takes care of retrieving and installing the required components can be downloaded. The same tool lets you switch between and update (and uninstall) these components as well. This is the recommended way.



    - Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - rustup (https://rustup.rs)
    - rustc (and the rest of the compiler toolchains)
    - cargo
    - RLS (short for Rust Language Server—this is for autocompletion)
    - Rust language support for Visual Studio Code
    
  
# Getting ready

- On a computer running either macOS, Linux, or Windows, only a web browser and internet connection are required. Bear in mind that the Windows installation works a little bit different from the *nix systems (Linux and macOS), which use scripts. 

# How to do it...

Each of the parts requires us to navigate to their respective websites, download the installer, and follow their instructions:
 
   -  Open the browser and navigate to (https://rustup.rs) and (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   -  Choose the installers fit for your operating system.
   - After downloading, run the installers and follow their instructions, choosing the stable branches.
   - Once successfully installed, we'll go deeper into each installation.
