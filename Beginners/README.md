#  Starting Off with Rust

The Rust ecosystem has grown considerably over the last year, and the 2018 edition, in particular, brought a significant push toward stabilization. The tooling is developing and important libraries are maturing to a point where many bigger companies use Rust in production.

It is not uncommon for experienced programmers in other languages (such as C#) to feel overwhelmed with the way things are done in Rust. we will try to overcome this and lower the bar to get started!
